Coworking Space Market Analysis & Customer Churn Prediction

An in-depth data analysis project examining the key factors (pricing, amenities, location) influencing customer acquisition, churn, and competitive switching within the coworking industry. Utilized publicly available data and simulated market research insights to provide data-driven recommendations.

Project Overview

During my internship at AGR Knowledge Services, I worked on a project analyzing coworking spaces such as WeWork, Spaces, and Regus.
The goal was to understand how pricing, amenities, and services affect customer behavior—including:
New customer acquisition
Existing customer retention
Customer churn
Switching between coworking companies

Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard to explore patterns across multiple dimensions:
Customer demographics
Monthly spend
Team size
Company amenities
Satisfaction survey scores
Locations

The dashboard allows dynamic filtering and visualization to extract actionable insights for coworking space providers.

Datasets Used
customers.csv – Customer details, join & exit dates, monthly spend, team size, churn status.
usage_monthly.csv – Monthly usage and engagement data per customer.
survey.csv – Customer satisfaction and feedback survey scores.
companies.csv – Company amenities, services offered, and locations.

⚡ Note: All datasets are simulated for the purpose of this analysis but closely resemble real-world coworking data.

Key Insights
1. Churn Analysis
Identified which companies have higher churn and which customer segments are more likely to leave.

2. Pricing Impact
Monthly spend correlates with churn, showing the effect of pricing on customer retention.

3. Amenities & Satisfaction
Amenities like meeting rooms, high-speed internet, and events significantly impact customer satisfaction and retention.

4. Customer Trends
Visualized new customer acquisition over time and tracked customer movement between coworking companies.

5. Location Analysis
Some cities show higher retention rates, helping companies focus on strategic locations.

Outcome

This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making for coworking space operators. By understanding customer behavior, pricing strategies, and amenity preferences, companies can:

✅ Reduce churn by focusing on key amenities

✅ Adjust pricing strategies to retain customers

✅ Target high-potential locations for expansion

✅ Improve overall customer satisfaction
